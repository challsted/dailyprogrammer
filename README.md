===============

This is an attempt at completeing some of the daily programmer chalanges over at [/r/dailyprogrammer][sr1]

I will attempt to name all posts as such:

    $DAY-$CHALANGENUM-$LANG

According to the subreddit:

The typical posting of challenges occur on or near the following days.

    Mon [Easy]
    Wed [Intermediate]
    Fri [Hard]

So a post could look like this:

    Montog-#123-SH
    Wed-#212-C++
    Friday-#23-Python

Basically, the day (might use Easy, Medium/Intermediate/Hard also....), the chalange number, then the language I used. 
I encourge peer review of these, and I plan to share this to the subreddit when I can actually post ontime.
